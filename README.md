# RoboND-MayMyWorld-Project

The third project of the Udacity Robotics Software Nanodegree Program Term 2.

In this project, I created a ROS package that utilizes [RTAB-Map](http://introlab.github.io/rtabmap/) to solve the SLAM problem in a predefined gazebo environment. Using the implemented package, I manually controlled a robot and created 2D and 3D maps of two different environments.

More details are explained in the [writeup](https://github.com/shingo-uzuki/RoboND-MayMyWorld-Project/blob/master/submission/RoboND-MapMyWorld-writeup.pdf).
